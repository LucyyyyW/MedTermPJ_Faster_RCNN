# MedTermPJ_Faster_RCNN

Object Detection

We implement Faster_RCNN on VOC2007 dataset on pytorch. We train the model on VOC2007train, validate on VOC2007val and finally test on VOC2007test.

You can easily download VOC2007 via and put them into /data/.

1. train
```Shell
python main.py
```
2. test 
edit the data path with your own dataset.
```Shell
python test.py
```

3. Visualization
edit the data path with your own image path.
```Shell
python visualization.py
```
